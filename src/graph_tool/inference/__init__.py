"""``graph_tool.inference`` - Statistical inference of generative network models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module contains algorithms for the identification of large-scale network
structure via the statistical inference of generative models.

.. note::

   included in the cookbook section: :ref:`inference-howto`.
